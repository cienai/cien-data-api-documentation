The team pulls up X number of completed deals (usually just a\nfraction of all the deals in a quarter) and looks at what happened, what the customer did, how the rep responded and any\nother facts relevant to that speci fi c deal; for example, where the customer was located or which industry it was in.\nThis analysis is often useful to understand broad trends, but it does not help much in ongoing global analysis of all deals\nand the most important factors for those, since most data is usually not readily available in the CRM database. And even if\nthe data points are present, they are usually not adjusted based on data quality. E.g., raw activity count may vary a lot\ndepending on if the rep is automatically recording their activities or not, whereas the stakeholders_all_adj_duration\nfi eld estimates the total time the team has spent on the deal in a speci fi c step, accounting for various levels of logging and\nprep time.\nCien makes that type of analysis available with a minimum of e ff ort using the ssr_history entity grouping by the\nstep_outcome fi eld.

Cien does that automatically, and also has an Admin\ntool that lets you override the role, group and manager classi fi cation manually. That way you know you have the correct\nbase data for all other performance analysis (because it would not make a lot of sense to compare junior SDR with a Senior\nEnterprise rep for example).\nThis data resides in the users entity, which then gets copied over to the users_history table, so it can be tracked over time.\nAs with most other entities, this data gets retroactively populated for multiple years upon initial processing of a CRM\ndataset.\nThe key fi elds are the trueai_user_role (a set of 15 speci fi c CRM user roles), trueai_user_role_function\n(consolidated into higher level functions such as AE, AM, SDR etc.) and trueai_termination_date (which looks for\nmultiple signals that a user is terminated \u2013 e.g. no logins or no activities in addition to the active fl ag)."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.hr,{}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Example SQL"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"select-10",children:"SELECT"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Y.year as year, -- the year\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN date_part('year', U.trueai_hire_date) < Y.year AND date_part('year',\nCOALESCE(U.trueai_termination_date, make_date(2100, 1,1))) >= Y.Year THEN U._sys_doc_id END) as\nsales_user_count_boy, -- users in the beginning of the year\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN date_part('year', U.trueai_hire_date) = Y.year THEN U._sys_doc_id END) as\nsales_user_hired, -- count of hired\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN date_part('year', COALESCE(U.trueai_termination_date, make_date(2100, 1,1))) =\nY.year THEN U._sys_doc_id END)* -1 as sales_user_terminated, -- count of terminated (turn into neg\nnumber)\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN date_part('year', U.trueai_hire_date) <= Y.year AND date_part('year',\nCOALESCE(U.trueai_termination_date, make_date(2100, 1,1))) > Y.Year THEN U._sys_doc_id END) as\nsales_user_count_eoy, -- end of year count, should match next year boy\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN U.trueai_user_role_function = 'AE' AND date_part('year', U.trueai_hire_date) <=\nY.year AND date_part('year', COALESCE(U.trueai_termination_date, make_date(2100, 1,1))) > Y.Year THEN\nU._sys_doc_id END) as ae_count_eoy, -- account execs s at end of year (use user_role_function field\ninstead of user_role to simplify query)\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN U.trueai_user_role_function = 'AM' AND date_part('year', U.trueai_hire_date) <=\nY.year AND date_part('year', COALESCE(U.trueai_termination_date, make_date(2100, 1,1))) > Y.Year THEN\nU._sys_doc_id END) as am_count_eoy,-- account managers at end of year (use user_role_function field\ninstead of user_role to simplify query)\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN U.trueai_user_role_function = 'SDR' AND date_part('year', U.trueai_hire_date)\n<= Y.year AND date_part('year', COALESCE(U.trueai_termination_date, make_date(2100, 1,1))) > Y.Year\nTHEN U._sys_doc_id END) as sdr_count_eoy,-- sales development reps at end of year (use\nuser_role_function field instead of user_role to simplify query)\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN U.trueai_user_role_function = 'MGMT' AND date_part('year', U.trueai_hire_date)\n<= Y.year AND date_part('year', COALESCE(U.trueai_termination_date, make_date(2100, 1,1))) > Y.Year\nTHEN U._sys_doc_id END) as mgmt_count_eoy,-- managers at end of year (use user_role_function field\ninstead of user_role to simplify query)\nCopyright \xa9 2023 - Cien, Inc. - All Rights Reserved. 30\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN U.trueai_user_role_function = 'OTHER' AND date_part('year', U.trueai_hire_date)\n<= Y.year AND date_part('year', COALESCE(U.trueai_termination_date, make_date(2100, 1,1))) > Y.Year\nTHEN U._sys_doc_id END) as other_count_eoy,-- others (e.g. sales engineers) at end of year (use\nuser_role_function field instead of user_role to simplify query)\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN date_part('year', U.trueai_hire_date) <= Y.year AND date_part('year',\nCOALESCE(U.trueai_termination_date, make_date(2100, 1,1))) > Y.Year THEN U._sys_doc_id END) /\nCAST(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN U.trueai_user_role_function = 'MGMT' AND date_part('year',\nU.trueai_hire_date) <= Y.year AND date_part('year', COALESCE(U.trueai_termination_date, make_date(2100,\n1,1))) > Y.Year THEN U._sys_doc_id END) as decimal) as rep_mgr_ratio_eoy\nFROM users as U -- get the user info\nCROSS JOIN (\nSELECT 2021 as year UNION\nSELECT 2020 as year UNION\nSELECT 2019 as year UNION\nSELECT 2018 as year UNION\nSELECT 2017 as year\n) as Y -- create a pseudo year table to cross reference against\nWHERE U.trueai_user_role_dept = 'SALES' -- only the sales users\nGROUP BY Y.year -- group by year\nORDER BY 1 DESC; -- most recent data"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.hr,{}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"sample-result-13",children:"Sample Result"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In this case, the team has grown consistently for the last 5 years, with the biggest increase in account management,\nre fl ecting the larger # of supported accounts.
