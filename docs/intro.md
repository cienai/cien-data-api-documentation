Welcome to the Cien API documentation. This site helps you discover available data entities and use them in analytics tools.

What you’ll find here:

- Entities: a field-by-field reference for every dataset we publish.
- Examples & Queries: copyable query patterns and tips.
- API Reference: how to connect, authenticate, and page through results.
- Rules: business logic and conventions that apply across datasets.

Quick navigation:

- Browse Entities from the sidebar. Each page lists fields, types, and descriptions.
- Use Examples for ready-made queries. A page-level TOC lets you jump to sections.
- See API Reference for base URL, authentication, pagination, and error formats.
- Review Rules for naming, IDs, and data handling conventions.

If you’re migrating from the old PDF, the same sections exist here in a searchable web format. Where appropriate, we’ve linked out to Power BI specific notes and measures.
