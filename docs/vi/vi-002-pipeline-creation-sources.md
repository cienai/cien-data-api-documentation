## Description

### Purpose of Analysis

Pipeline value is often created by multiple roles across the organization. Leads may be sourced by marketing or SDR teams, while opportunities are later developed, qualified, and closed by sales reps.

Without understanding where pipeline value originates, performance evaluation can overemphasize closing outcomes and underrepresent value creation earlier in the process.

The TrueAI platform captures attribution signals that allow pipeline value to be traced back to its creation sources.

**This analysis answers:**  
Who creates pipeline value, and how is that value distributed across sourcing roles and teams?

## Query

### Query Intent

This query attributes pipeline value to the role or source responsible for initial creation. By aggregating opportunity value by creation source, it highlights how different functions contribute to pipeline generation.

The query supports fair attribution by separating value creation from value conversion.

```sql
SELECT
  pipeline_source,
  source_role,
  COUNT(*) AS opportunity_count,
  SUM(trueai_pipeline_value) AS total_pipeline_value,
  AVG(trueai_pipeline_value) AS avg_pipeline_value

FROM ssr

WHERE trueai_pipeline_value IS NOT NULL

GROUP BY
  pipeline_source,
  source_role

ORDER BY
  total_pipeline_value DESC;
```

### Sample Output

In this example, SDR-sourced opportunities represent a large share of total pipeline value, while sales-sourced opportunities tend to have higher average value per opportunity.

| pipeline_source | source_role | opportunity_count | total_pipeline_value | avg_pipeline_value |
| --- | --- | ---:| ---:| ---:|
| Inbound | SDR | 412 | 12,840,000 | 31,165 |
| Outbound | SDR | 296 | 9,210,000 | 31,108 |
| Self-Sourced | AE | 143 | 6,980,000 | 48,812 |
| Partner | Partner | 61 | 3,420,000 | 56,066 |
| Marketing | Marketing | 188 | 4,110,000 | 21,862 |

## How to Interpret the Results

- `total_pipeline_value` shows cumulative value generated by each source
- `avg_pipeline_value` highlights differences in opportunity size by source
- High total value indicates volume-driven contribution
- High average value suggests fewer but larger opportunities

## Why This Matters

Pipeline creation analysis:
- clarifies how value is generated across roles,
- supports fair attribution and incentive design,
- and prevents over-crediting closing performance alone.

This example complements lead value distribution by making value creation visible throughout the pipeline lifecycle.
