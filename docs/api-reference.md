This site focuses on field‑level documentation per entity.

For practical usage:
- Browse the “Entities” section for all fields and types.
- Use “Get started” to understand navigation.
- See “Examples & Queries” for copyable patterns.

If detailed API method docs are added later, they’ll appear here.
